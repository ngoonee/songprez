  <lyrics>[V1]
 Children in the wilderness
 Following the love You poured out for us
 Covered by the Name that we confess
 Jesus Saviour forever
 ||
 Roaming through the dark of night
 Clinging to the word that burns deep inside
 Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light
 Jesus Saviour forever

[C]
 Set alight to follow
 In the shadow of Your Name
 The world is Yours and I know
 Everything will find its place
 Under Your Name

[V2]
 Walking on through the fire
 Knowing I will not be burned but refined
 Fearless in Your Name ever by my side
 Jesus Saviour forever
 ||
 Taking on the raging storm
 Anchored to the kingdom unshakable
 Holding to Your Name that outshines all
 Jesus Saviour forever


[B]
 Children of the light
 Blazing through the night
 Taking back what the devil had stolen
 ||
 Calling on Your Name
 Breaking every chain
 Jesus everlasting freedom
 ||
 Running through the wild
 Dancing in the fire
 Taking back what the devil had stolen
 ||
 Calling on Your Name
 Breaking every chain
 Jesus everlasting freedom

[C2]
 Set alight to follow
 In the shadow of Your Name
 The world is Yours and I know
 Everything will find its place

[C3]
 Set alight to follow
 In the shadow of Your Name
 The world is Yours and I know
 Everything will find its place
 Under Your Name
 Jesus under Your Name

[E]
 Jesus
 All the power
 All the glory
 All the praise be to Your Name forever
